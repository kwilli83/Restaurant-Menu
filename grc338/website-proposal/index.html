        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p> Chutsy's </p>

        <p> Chutsy's is a malt/dessert shop that offers various milkshakes and desserts, but, like a cat café, there are shelter cats to pet here too. This business would offer guests a fun, relaxing experience while also helping to get homeless cats adopted. </p>

        <h2>Target audience</h2>

        <p>The target audience of this website will be potential customers of the location. They might be younger people, likely in their 20s, who want to relax and who generally enjoy cats. </p>

        <p>Their primary goals with this website would be too find out more about the business, including the hours, address, etc. They will also be able to view some of the menu items, and see which cats will be there, and how to adopt. </p>
