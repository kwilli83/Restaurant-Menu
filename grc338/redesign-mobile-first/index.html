      <h2>Let Us Introduce Ourselves....</h2>
      <p>
         We, Allan and Lois Crawford, are proprietors of California Coin and Stamp, located in San Luis Obispo, CA. since 1992. Our business originated in Oakland, CA in 1977 with the specific goal, then and now, of serving collectors, both the beginner and the serious collector, both buyer and seller. It was to be also a place where gold, silver and platinum bullion could be bought and sold based on accurate industry pricing. We planned it to be a store where nice, problem free, professionally graded and fairly priced coins and stamps and currency would be available, along with assorted supplies related to the hobbies. And of course the customer would be waited upon by a friendly staff, usually the two of us! Since then we have helped many, young and old develop always good looking  and sometimes valuable collections depending on how much has been invested. Educating our customers is always a priority with us, helping them to collect wisely. In addition we take very seriously the responsibility to help them to understand why adding gold or silver or both to their portfolios is a wise step especially now in what appears to be an uncertain economical situation facing our country. Coins and currency can be submitted to NGC or ANACS for professional grading or authentication through our store.

         “Called and got a message saying that he's open Tuesday - Saturday and that they might be there on Monday afternoon so we showed up about 1:30 on Monday and he was open. A great COMPLETE selection of US and World coins fairly priced. The staff was most pleasant and dug out items from the back which were of interest. I wish that they were open past 4:00 today as I would have liked to have seen more. I will be back on another trip. Forget the other so-called coin/stamp shop in SLO and go to this SERIOUS store. FIVE stars all the way!”

         “Came in with thirty dollars, not sure what I wanted. The couple that owns the shop helped me leave very satisfied! There is a wide selection at varying prices, some only a couple of dollars.
         Pros: Coins, Numismatics, Service, Atmosphere”
