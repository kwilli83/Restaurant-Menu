      <h1> Business Statement</h1>
      <p>We have high quality customers in these peaceful communities of California's Central Coast... nice, nice people.  And every one who walks through our business door has particular and/or special needs, and to the best of our ability we work to serve those needs, which can include something as easy and as simple as basic questions about buying or selling stamps or coins or about the various types of bullion gold and silver.</p>
      <p>Our policy is to take care of every customers needs to the best of our ability and still allow the business to thrive! Now having said that we would like to share some rationale regarding the questions a business like ours deals with daily.</p>
      <h2>Questions we are regularly asked:</h2>
      <p>Today with all the interest in gold and silver, individuals want to know how to buy it and then how to sell should they want or need to....there are questions regarding the best kinds of gold and silver to buy....needless to say, we spend considerable time talking the pros and cons of all of that.</p>
      <p>With beginning collectors the questions concern how to start putting together a collection what are the best coins or stamps to collect, with more mature collectors the discussions revolve around how to buy coins or stamps that will increase in value</p>
      <p>
         We have a large inventory of medium priced items. There is much for the collector to choose from among the coins and stamps that are currently available to collect....and no one business can have them all. We have chosen to focus on a good selection of graded, problem free U S coins and stamps... we have some currency, both U.S. and foreign and we stock some basic supplies.
      </p>
      <p>We work to keep our inventory fairly priced and if it is pointed out to us that we have made a pricing error, we double check the latest published pricing and adjust accordingly. However, at all times we have to price inventory and services correctly and competitively so that at the end of the day the business bills can be paid.</p>
      <p>Much of that process is straight forward. However many  collections, inherited and otherwise, contain much that has no commercial value and it is sometimes hard for heirs to believe that they possess items which have no current collector interest or intrinsic value.</p>
      <p>We share these thoughts with you hoping this bit of information provides a sense of what to expect when you visit.</p>
      <h2> Did You Know...</h2>
      <p> Jan 2017: Under current law, If your bank is failing and the U.S. government fails to bail them out, under a mandate titled Adequacy of Loss-Absorbing Capacity, approved by the G20, they can take your money and convert it into shares of equity in the failing institution. These laws exist and the public has no idea that access to their money can be confiscated as a big-bank "bail-in" to save U.S. banks from closing. Learn how to protect yourself from the next financial meltdown before it's too late!</p>
