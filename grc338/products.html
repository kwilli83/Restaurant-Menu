      <h1> Products</h1>
      <p>
         We want to give you an idea of some of the products we stock to help you collect, house, or display your collection....ie., For the wide inventory of US  coins, stamps and currency that we sell, we  try tohave on hand some of the  supplies that are generally used or needed by collectors, both  beginners and the veterans.
      </p>

         For example if our customer wants to interest his seven year old, boy or girl, in the ‘art’ of collecting coins he  will probably begin by giving him or her one or more Whitman folders  usually beginning with the Lincoln penny series. This allows the collector to accumulate and to have a place to display,in date sequence, all the Lincoln cents. And if the collector has a few extra dollars to spend on his own collection, we can take care of him or her also! We have coins from all over the world but we specialize in coins of the United States and will have many trays of  coins of each modern denomination, starting with the earliest dates, all available for our customers  to look at.

      <h4>from article in The Silver Bear Cafe, October 2016</h4>
      <p> Among all the choices you have for gold and silver bullion, genuinely historic metal is still around at reasonable prices. The runaway classic is ninety-percent U.S. silver coinage... dimes, quarters, half dollars, old Morgan and Peace dollars... The lyrical ring of a handful of silver coins speaks not only to the history of the United States but also to the entire heritage of sound money. Simply put, pre-1965 silver used to be called "pocket change." Everyone had some, saved some, spent some. Silver money was a natural part of everyday life</p>
